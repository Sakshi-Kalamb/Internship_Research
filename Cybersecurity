## 1. What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the **practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data** from cyberattacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft.  

### 🔑 Core Goals (CIA Triad +)
- **Confidentiality** → Protect data from unauthorized access  
- **Integrity** → Ensure data is accurate and unaltered  
- **Availability** → Ensure systems are available when needed  
- **+ Authenticity, Non-repudiation, Privacy, Resilience**  

### 🛡️ Scope of Cybersecurity
- **Technical**: Networks, cloud, apps, IoT, endpoints, AI pipelines  
- **Operational**: Threat detection, SOC operations, incident response  
- **Governance**: Policies, compliance, vendor/supply chain assurance  

---

## 2. Why is Cybersecurity Important?
- 📈 Increasing **cybercrime costs** globally (trillions of $ lost yearly).  
- 🔐 Protection of **personal data** (Aadhaar, banking, health records).  
- 🏢 Safeguards **business continuity** and trust.  
- 🌍 Ensures **national security** (critical infrastructure, defense).  
- ⚖️ Helps meet **legal & regulatory compliance** (GDPR, HIPAA, IT Act).  

---

## 3. Challenges in Cybersecurity
- 🚨 **Evolving threat landscape** (AI-powered attacks, ransomware-as-a-service).  
- 🛠️ **Skill shortage** → Demand for professionals > Supply.  
- ☁️ **Cloud security** misconfigurations.  
- 📱 **IoT devices** with weak/no security.  
- 🏢 **Insider threats** (employees, contractors).  
- 🔄 **Rapid digital transformation** → Attack surface keeps expanding.  
- 💰 **Cost of implementation** for small/medium enterprises.  

---

## 4. Cybersecurity Trends
- 🤖 **AI in cybersecurity** (AI-powered defense and attacks).  
- ☁️ **Zero Trust Architecture** adoption.  
- 🧑‍💻 **XDR (Extended Detection & Response)**.  
- 🏢 **Cloud-native security** tools.  
- 🔐 **Passwordless authentication** (biometrics, passkeys).  
- 📡 **IoT/OT security** gaining importance.  
- 🛡️ **Regulatory compliance & privacy laws** enforcement.

## 5. Common Cyberattacks & Solutions

### 🔥 Major Cyberattacks
- **Malware** → Viruses, worms, trojans, spyware.  
  ✅ Solution: Antivirus, patching, firewalls, behavior monitoring.  

- **Phishing** → Fake emails/websites tricking users.  
  ✅ Solution: Email filters, user training, 2FA.  

- **Password Attacks** → Brute force, credential stuffing.  
  ✅ Solution: Strong passwords, MFA, password managers.  

- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)** → Flooding servers with traffic.  
  ✅ Solution: Load balancers, DDoS mitigation services (Cloudflare, AWS Shield).  

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** → Intercepting communication.  
  ✅ Solution: HTTPS, VPN, encryption, secure Wi-Fi.  

- **Drive-by Download** → Malicious code auto-installed from websites.  
  ✅ Solution: Updated browsers, disable auto-downloads, endpoint security.  

- **Malvertising** → Malware spread via online ads.  
  ✅ Solution: Ad blockers, secure ad networks, anti-malware.  

- **Rogue Software (Fake Antivirus)** → Tricks user to install malware.  
  ✅ Solution: Awareness, allow only trusted software, EDR.  

### ⚡ Other Attacks
- SQL Injection  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
- Insider Attacks  
- Supply Chain Attacks

## 6. ITAM vs CSAM (Table)

| Feature              | ITAM (IT Asset Management)                  | CSAM (Cybersecurity Asset Management) |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Focus**            | Tracking IT assets (hardware/software)      | Security visibility & risk of assets  |
| **Objective**        | Inventory, cost mgmt, lifecycle mgmt        | Detect shadow IT, vulnerabilities, compliance |
| **Data Collected**   | Asset type, ownership, cost                 | Configs, vulnerabilities, exposure    |
| **Primary Users**    | IT, Finance, Procurement teams              | Security, Risk, Compliance teams      |
| **Outcome**          | Efficient IT operations, cost savings       | Reduced cyber risk, stronger defense  |

## 7. CSAM (Cybersecurity Asset Management)
CSAM is the **process of continuously identifying, classifying, and securing all assets** (devices, apps, cloud resources, IoT, containers) within an organization.  

### 🎯 Goals
- 100% visibility of all digital assets  
- Detect **shadow IT** and unmanaged devices  
- Assess **security posture** of each asset  
- Automate **patching, monitoring, compliance checks**  

### 🛠️ Benefits
- Stronger security operations  
- Reduced attack surface  
- Easier compliance reporting  
- Faster incident response  

---

## 📖 Glossary
- **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability  
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify  
- **XDR**: Extended Detection & Response  
- **Shadow IT**: Assets deployed without IT/security approval
